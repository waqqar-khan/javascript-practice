# JavaScript Concepts in Code

### Function Statement or Function Declaration:
A function declaration is created with the function keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and the function body in curly braces.

### Higher Order Function (HOF):
A higher-order function (HOF) is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result.

### Function Expression
A function expression in JavaScript is another way to define a function, where the function is created as part of an expression. In contrast to function declarations, function expressions do not necessarily require a function name (anonymous function), and they can be used where an expression is expected. Another way to create an anonymous function expression is by using the arrow function syntax (introduced in ECMAScript 6).
Function expressions are often used in situations where you need to pass a function as an argument to another function, create functions dynamically, or implement concepts like immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE).

### Anonymous Function
An anonymous function in JavaScript is a function that does not have a name. It can be created using a function expression, and it is often used in situations where the function is short-lived or used as an argument to another function.
Anonymous functions are commonly used in situations where a function is used once and doesn't need to be referred to by name elsewhere in the code, such as when passing a function as an argument to another function or when using immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE).
